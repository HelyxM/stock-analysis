# An Analysis of All Stock Values For Selected Years 2017 and 2018
[VBA_Challenge](VBA_Challenge.zip)

## **Overview of Project**:
The main intention of this analysis is to provide a working macro or subroutine to analyze all given stock data for the given year and provide an easy-to-access table of the important values related to each group's stock performances over the course of the year in question. The initial column provides the ticker name of each stock entity and is followed by a column for both the daily volume of trades and the percentage of returns for investments, respectively. The workbook file also includes a button for easy execution of the subroutine, for which the program prompts the user to input their desired year parameter, and a second button to clear all occupied cells in the analysis worksheet for the user to re-run the subroutine for a follow-up analysis. This subroutine was then refactored to determine differences in the speed of execution between the initial construction of VBA code to run the analysis and a more streamlined format that would yield the same result.

### *Purpose*
The purpose behind this re-working of the code from the initially constructed subroutine was to use Excel's timer function to have an immediately accessible value to compare how the efficiency of code can impact the time needed to execute the subroutine. The message box that the user would see after running the subroutine provides a comparable time needed to run the subroutines.
